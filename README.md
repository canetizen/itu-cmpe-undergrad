# Istanbul Technical University (ITU) CMPE Course Materials

This repository contains materials related to the courses I took in the Computer Engineering Department at Istanbul Technical University. The folders named "previous" or "past" may include source codes and written solutions compiled from various platforms such as Not Kutusu. All source codes and written solutions outside of these folders are entirely my own work.

Please use these materials as a learning aid rather than simply copying them.

I do not claim ownership of the materials prepared by the course instructors. If any of the instructors would like me to remove specific content, they can reach out to me through the contact links available in my profile.
